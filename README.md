Better Autocomplete jQuery plugin
=================================

This jQuery plugin can be attached to text input fields for autocompletion,
using mouse and keyboard for selection. It can use both local sources (e.g. an
array) and remote sources (e.g. an AJAX path which delivers JSON/XML data
asynchronously).

The state of this plugin
------------------------

This plugin is as good as ready in many ways and is developed over a couple of
months, so the codebase is tested and refactored in many ways, *but* the
documentation is not up to date and there some non-critical featured yet to be
implemented.

Also in the case of Internet Explorer I can tell that it has *not* been tested
at all in none of IE browsers. It may just work perfectly fine (for IE7+) or
there may be small bugs or even critical bugs. Please feel free to fork and fix
these potential "bugs" but I wan't to keep the code clean, and I'm not willing
to do a lot of ugly hacks just for IE.
